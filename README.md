# Position list combined with deep autofocus


For any experiment requires over-night/24 hrs observation, e.g., drug treatment and changing of cell phase, it is essential to keep the objects at focus. In this work, the long-term observation was achieved by combining the works in https://github.com/tehsinchen/Deep_Autofocus and https://github.com/tehsinchen/Position_List_PIStage.


## Results

Below is the video that recorded the full operation of going to the pre-set destinations in position list, centralizing the cell and finding the focal plane. The process of centralizing was speeded up 15 times, 0.8x for finding focus, 1.2x for going to the next position.

For the option of non-fixed position which means the lateral and axial positions was updated by machine, here is the results of snapshot images:

For the option of fixed lateral-position which can be applied for watching the movement of cells, here is the results:
